## Adding Media

Adding media is very simple and can be found under the "Media" tab in the "section menu", which is the black "side-bar" you see to the left-hand side of the main display.

You need to select the appropriate folder for the file you want to upload, so if you have a PDF then select the "PDF" folder, if its a jpg, png, etc. then select the "picture" folder. We find that this is the simplest way of keeping all files organised. 
![Pick the Right Folder](Which_folder.png)
You will be shown a list of the files. 
![List of Files](list.png)
The "Upload Box" can be clicked on to upload files from your computer or you can drag and drop files into it.

Once media has uploaded, it will display a progress bar and once the upload is complete, the file will appear below the upload box, this is how you know the file has uploaded successfully.
Make sure you save when everything has uploaded!

## Editing Media

First you need to make sure that your new files are in the media libary, when this is done you can move on to the next step. You need to find the place that you want to update your media (e.g. "homepage/photos/page components/photos/portrait1"), ![Portrait 1](portrait1.png) then simply update it by deleting the old file (Look at Deleting Media) and then inserting the new file (Look at: Adding Media to your Content).
## Deleting Media

To delete media from the media libary, you need to go to the media libary, select the media that you wish to delete and a blue tick will appear at the top right of the files you select. ![Selected Files](selected_files.png) Then at the top of the page there is a "delete" button, ![Delete Button](delete_button.png) click that then click "okay" on the pop-up window and you will have successfully deleted the media.
## Adding Media to your Content

To add media to your content is ultimately the next step that you will want to take. ![Page Display](page_display.png)
You can add media to your content in a few different ways
- One way is by using the "Media Picker" tool. To do this, navigate to the page that you would like to add media to: (e.g.homepage/services/general-ear-nose-&-throat). ![Media Picker](media_picker.png) click the "Media Picker" icon ![More Media Picker](more_media_picker.png) select the file(s) you want and make sure to submit and save. ![Submit and Save](submit_and_save.png) 
- You can also add it as an image on its own. For example if you had a grid on your page and it was two columns wide like http://www.davidselvadurai.com/about/, then on the first column you could have a picture and then in the second one have text explaining the picture or writing something linked to the image. ![Example Page Grid](example_pg_grid.png) Let's say that we were looking to do this with something underneath, we go to the place in the back-office where we would like to add it in (e.g. homepage/about/page-components/grid),![Backoffice Grid Example](backoffice_grid_example.png) then we can click on "Add Content",![Add Content](add_content.png) it will display a menu, select the "image" option. ![Image Option](image_option.png) you will be given the option to select the image you want to add, so select one, submit and save! ![Grid Image](grid_image.png) ![Save and Publish](save_and_publish.png)
