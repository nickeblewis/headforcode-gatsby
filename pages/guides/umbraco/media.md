## Editing Media

First you need to make sure that your new files are in the media libary, when this is done you can move on to the next step. You need to find the place that you want to update your media (e.g. "homepage/photos/page components/photos/portrait1"), ![Portrait 1](portrait1.png) then simply update it by deleting the old file (Look at Deleting Media) and then inserting the new file (Look at: Adding Media to your Content).
## Deleting Media

To delete media from the media libary, you need to go to the media libary, select the media that you wish to delete and a blue tick will appear at the top right of the files you select. ![Selected Files](selected_files.png) Then at the top of the page there is a "delete" button, ![Delete Button](delete_button.png) click that then click "okay" on the pop-up window and you will have successfully deleted the media.

You can add media to your content in a few different ways
- one way is by using the "Media Picker" tool. To do this, navigate to the page that you would like to add media to: (e.g.homepage/services/general-ear-nose-&-throat). ![Media Picker](media_picker.png) click the "Media Picker" icon ![More Media Picker](more_media_picker.png) select the file/files you want and make sure to submit and save. ![Submit and Save](submit_and_save.png) 
- You can also add it as a image on its own. For example if you had a grid on your page and it was two colunms wide like http://www.davidselvadurai.com/about/, then on the first colunm you could have a picture and then in the second one had text explaining the picture or writing something linked to the image. ![Example Page Grid](example_page_grid.png) To add an image in so we get the same result as this, we go to the place where we would like to add it in the back office (e.g. homepage/about/page-components/grid),![Backoffice Grid Example](backoffice_grid_example.png) then we can click on "Add Content",![Add Content](add_content.png) it will then display a menu, select the "image" option. ![Image Option](image_option.png)
