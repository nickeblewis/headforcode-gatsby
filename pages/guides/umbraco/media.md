## Adding Media

Adding media is very simple. 
You need to navigate to the "Media" tab in the "section menu".
Then you need to select the right folder for the file you want to upload, so if you have a PDF then select the "PDF" folder,
if its a jpg, png, etc. then select the "picture" folder.
Then you will be displayed with a list of the media underneath a "Upload Box". 
The "Upload Box" can be clicked on to upload files from your computer or you can drag a drop files into it.
When media is uploaded, it will display a tick next to the file, this is how you know the file has uploaded successfully.

## Updating Media

First you need to make sure that your new files are in the media libary, when this is done you can move on to the next step.
You then need to find the place that you want to update your media (e.g. "homepage"), then simply update it by deleting the old file (Look at Deleting Media) and then inserting the new file (Look at: Adding Media to your Content).
## Deleting Media

To delete media you need to get to the media that you would like to gt rid of by going to the right folder and then cick on 
the media that you wish to delete and a blue tick will appear at the top right of the file.
Then at the top of the page there is a "delete" button, click that and you will have successfully deleted your desired media.

## Adding media to your content

To add media to your content is ultimatly the next step that you will want to take. 
You can add media to your content in a few different ways, one way is to go to a page in your site and then in the rich text
editor, you can add a image. Just like you would in a word document.
You can also add it as a image on its own. For example if you had a grid on your page and it was two colunms wide then on
the first colunm you could have a picture and then in the second one had text explaining the picture or writing something 
linked to the image.
