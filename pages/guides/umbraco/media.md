## Adding Media

Adding media is very simple. 

You need to navigate to the "Media" tab in the "section menu".

Then you need to select the right folder for the file you want to upload, so if you have a PDF then select the "PDF" folder,

if its a jpg, png, etc. then select the "picture" folder.

Then you will be displayed with a list of the media underneath a "Upload Box". 

The "Upload Box" can be clicked on to upload files from your computer or you can drag a drop files into it.

When media is uploaded, it will display a tick next to the file, this is how you know the file has uploaded successfully.
