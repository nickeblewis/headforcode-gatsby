## Adding Content

When adding content you need to know what you are looking to achieve in the end.
To add a new page, you select where you would like it to be displayed under in the tree (e.g. "homepage/events")
then you click on the elipses and select an item (e.g. "General Page").

## Editing Content

When editing content you also need to know what you want to achieve.
For example if you had spelling mistakes in the "homepage/events/charity-ball" then you would click the item in the tree
that contains the rich text editor then you can jump right in and edit it the way you would do with a word document.

## Deleting Content 

To delete content is pretty simple.
all that is required if deleting text is that you go to the required rich text editor, select the text you wish to delete and
then you can get rid of it as you would a word document.
