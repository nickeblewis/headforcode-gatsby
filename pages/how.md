How I built this application

fg-gatsby
headforcode-gatsby

- cd proj
- gatsby new headforcode-gatsby
- cd headforcode-gatsby
- npm install
- gatsby develop

So we now have a gatsby default site running at localhost:8000

- I then modified package.json with a script for "start" I prefer running npm start!!
