## 5.3 Identify the organisation’s structure, roles and responsibilities

    - Yes, pretty mucch and I would add that Tina is in fact a Director, we opted not to have a Secretary as it is no longer a legal requirement
    - We could research how other small startup companies are structured. 
- [ ] Roles and responsibilities you can have a go at making up
    - Let's chat about this in more detail and write up more detail here but some quick suggestions
        - Nick Lewis, Managing Director. I am a very non-traditional MD at the moment because my role is still and always will be very much a technical one. I will delegate more of my tasks to our Junior Developer as he evolves as a membr of the team.
        - Tina Lewis, Director. Tina has a wealth of knowledge about business, HSE, Laws and management. Tina is currently assigned to an off-site project for the next few years.
        - Dan Davis, Junior Developer. Dan is learning through his apprenticeship to become a developer.
