# Unit 202 : Develop own effectiveness and professionalism

There is plenty to discuss below and I think this is quite a good unit when I read it more carefully. The aim of this is to help you think a bit more about the business of the IT industry. We are small, we certainly aren't corporate but we should still portray a professional image nonetheless. So let's start to make some progress on this and I will welcome any suggestions you make. There is never a daft question or idea (I've been told!).

- 5.1 [List the aims and objectives of the organisation](5.1)
- 5.2 [State the organisation’s brand or image](5.2)
- 5.3 [Identify the organisation’s structure, roles and responsibilities](5.3)
- 5.4 [Identify potential improvements to working practices](5.4)

## Notes from Nick

Tina provided many of the hints above and there are quite a few things we need to help you with here for this part of Unit 202. So I am going to update this page further with links to further information and some new tasks that we can carry out in order to complete 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4
