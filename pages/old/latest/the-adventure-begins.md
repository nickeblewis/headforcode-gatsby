## The gist of it is this

HeadForCode is a new thing, we have been quietly chipping away at the idea now for about a year and the website has been something of a background project for awhile. We have also been talking about the idea behind it with various people and with the aim of creating a small team to help develop the concept further. How did it come about? What exactly is HeadForCode?

Let us first talk about **Code** itself...

I am a firm believer that the world in which we live is not going to sit still for long and if anything, it is going to get a lot more *fidgety* in the next few years. If you are a "Coder" you are going to have a very interesting time because I feel that many of the things we once considered to be the norm not so long ago, will become anything but. I also believe that more and more people will become involved in **Code** but maybe not in the traditional sense. I think everyone will soon be getting their hands dirty and building their own things. We are already seeing a proliferation of "build your own site without knowing anything about programming" services popping up left right and center, such as Wix and Squarespace for example. A lot of people have asked me about what people in my business will do when systems become able to write their own code, relegating developers to the dole queue? No that won't happen because we will still be needed to build such systems in the first place... as I say there are a lot off interesting things bubbling away across the World that will reshape the industry. It has evolved massively since the late 80's when I was learning to write programs in machine-code, assembly language and C\+\+.

So we at HeadForCode we focus on research, mentoring and consultancy. We explore new ideas of how you can use code to improve the way you as an individual or as a business get the level best out of your technology, no matter whether we are talking about the web or mobile. We consider ourselves to have a "good head for code" much the same as a mathmetician has a good head for numbers or a historian can recall the dates of famous battles. You get the gist.

Knowledge is all very well but there is no point keeping it locked in our heads and that is why we like to mentor people and help them learn. To level up as we like to say.

We shall be running a number of online courses through this website.

## The website

We like to be revolutionary here and when it came to building this website, we first considered the normal paths that we could follow, we thought about using Wordpress or Drupal. We then thought again and hav opted to take a very different path by using the so called JAM Stack as our approach

## The team

We operate out of an office in Farnborough, Hampshire, England. Just two of us. We have a third person too on the board of Directors but she is working on a different project at the current time. We plan to expand when we need to and we will probably only ever work with freelancers who could be working anywhere in the UK and beyond. In the future we may even stop renting office space and instead switch to a system by which we work from anywhere, wherever we are at any particular time.

My partner in crime is a young apprentice by the name of Dan Davis, he is learning fast and has a fabulous aptitude for the technology that we are working with.

## Our next steps

We are building this site using what we call "modern methods" but some of them may not sound that way, as we shall explain in the next article in this blog, keep your eyes peeled..
