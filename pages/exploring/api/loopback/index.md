## Benefits of LoopBack

The ability to build your own API quickly and your code is automatically generated along the way. You are given a choice of being able to store data in memory, in a file or you can of course hook up with external datasources of pretty much any kind.
## Building an API

``` bash
npm install -g loopback-cli
mkdir my-loopback
cd my-loopback
node .
```
