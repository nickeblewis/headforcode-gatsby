Working out how to change this to return some extra data

``` js
const getSimpleType = prefix =>
  map(({ code, id }) => ({
    label: code || id,
    value: code || id,
    i18nKey: `${prefix}:${code || id}`
  }));

const getComplexType = prefix =>
  compose(
    getSimpleType(prefix),
    map(({ roleDataItems }) =>
      roleDataItems.reduce((x, { key, value }) =>
        ({ ...x, [key.toLowerCase()]: value }), {}))
  );

const getComplexTypeForInsurer = prefix =>
  compose(
    getSimpleType(prefix),
    map(({ roleDataItems }) =>
      roleDataItems.reduce((x, { key, value }) =>
        ({ ...x, [key.toLowerCase()]: value }), {}))
  );
  ```
There is a lot going on in the above despite it being a short piece of code. 

We pass prefix through to getCTFI and in this instance I want to know what happens when we pass in 'insurerType'. I know that as a result of calling getST it must be pulling in the array roleDataItems from the insurers object.

I am totally stuck with this at the moment but want to get to grips with it!!!

During today I have read some great resources that help explain these seemingly complex concepts. Functional programming is sauting, especially if you (like me) come from the imperative world but master it I must...
