Step through...

## configStore is called

* getInitialState is called first of all
* makes a call to API endpoint ```http://localhost:8000/service/broker/get-branch-config.json```
* ```results.LookupData.insurers``` which is a large array split into groups, so to get at roleDataItems a complete path would look like ```results.LookupData.insurers[0].roleDataItems``` which is in itself an array of objects.

The item below is a snippet of this data

```js
"roleDataItems":
  [
    { "_type":"roleDataItem",
      "key":"Code",
      "value":"040"
    },
    { "_type":"roleDataItem",
      "key":"Name",
      "value":"ACCIDENT MANAGEMENT"
    }
  ]
```


``` js
const getSimpleType = prefix =>
  map(({ code, id }) => ({
    label: code || id,
    value: code || id,
    i18nKey: `${prefix}:${code || id}`
  }));

const getComplexType = prefix =>
  compose(
    getSimpleType(prefix),
    map(({ roleDataItems }) =>
      roleDataItems.reduce((x, { key, value }) =>
        ({ ...x, [key.toLowerCase()]: value }), {}))
  );

const getComplexTypeForInsurer = prefix =>
  compose(
    getSimpleType(prefix),
    map(({ roleDataItems }) =>
      roleDataItems.reduce((x, { key, value }) =>
        ({ ...x, [key.toLowerCase()]: value }), {}))
  );
  ```
There is a lot going on in the above despite it being a short piece of code. 

We pass prefix through to getCTFI and in this instance I want to know what happens when we pass in 'insurerType'. I know that as a result of calling getST it must be pulling in the array roleDataItems from the insurers object.

I am totally stuck with this at the moment but want to get to grips with it!!!

During today I have read some great resources that help explain these seemingly complex concepts. Functional programming is sauting, especially if you (like me) come from the imperative world but master it I must...
