Depending on whether you are a developer reading this or someone who is checking us out, a potential client perhaps, this article is not written in the technical context, we shall come back to that in later articles and talk about how we do stuff here...

What is GatsbyJS and how can you compare it to something like Wordpress. Well for starters the two are very different but then we are a different kind of web consultancy who prefer to help our client base produce their content rather than necessarily giving them the keys and forgetting about them...

In the past we used to build sites with PHP but then JavaScript gained a huge boost thanks to the likes of JQuery followed by Angular and React. In parallel to this we used to use CMS systems such as Wordpress and Drupal which are both based on PHP. We also built some sites using Umbraco which is based on Microsoft's .NET framework.... So as you can see quite a mixture of technologies involved and it started to become pretty hard to follow the progress of them all. 

All of the above share one thing in common and they all require some form of database in order to function plus as systems, traditionally they are all fairly tightly-coupled in their architecture. In other words as a developer, you have had to build sites using their own templating language and all of the code is mixed in.

Anyway this article is not going to delve into the complexities of Wordpress, there are plenty of others out there for that purpose, I am here to introduce you to GatsbyJS!

Gatsby is a different concept
