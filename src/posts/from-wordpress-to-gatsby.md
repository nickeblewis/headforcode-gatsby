I had been building sites with tools such as Wordpress and Drupal but also being a developer, I love to build sites with React JS, the library that has come out of Facebook. Not so long ago I was exploring the potential of building sites that don't have a strict database back-end but instead rely on static files. I ran through so many options and whilst many were good, none of them really did what I actually wanted. Gatsby changed that and so I began to make the switch. My oh my what a pleasure it has been and opens up more possibilities than you would think.

We use Git for version control of our projects and when pushing changes up, that effectively also acts as a "publish" action, since our account with Netlify picks up these changes and deploys them automatically. So the workflow has been revolutionised too. Making it a lot easier for me to deliver client projects and when needed, juggling them all is less of a chore, in fact a joy!
