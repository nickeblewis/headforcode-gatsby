We are big fans of GatsbyJS and since this website is built with it, we are interested to find out who else use the tool for building their sites. So I am having a look around the web for those sites, to find out how other developers use GatsbyJS. I shall also talk a little bit about our uses for it so far and how we shall expand upon it in the future.

### How to GraphQL

GraphQL is another technology that we are excited about at HeadForCode, after all GatsbyJS v1.x uses it as a means of querying site content as if it were data taken off a database. I'm assuming that you know a little bit about how GatsbyJS works at this point here. We are also working on some other projects that use GraphQL but that is something I shall save for future articles.... 

GraphCool put together an excellent learning resource called How to GraphQL and guess what? It is built using GatsbyJS and what's more they have made the source code available for developers like us to peruse and learn from. So you get two great learning resources in one effectively!

Could be worth adding https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-twitter/ to share the original tweet that inspired this article
