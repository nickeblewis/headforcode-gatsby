Expo is a tool for building React Native apps without the need for installing tools such as Xcode on the Mac. Expo is available for Mac and Windows users, is easy to install and to get going in a matter of minutes. You can also experiment with ideas for mobile UI  without needing to install anything. This is where Expo "snacks" come into the equation. Here is a neat little example in action...

<div data-snack-id="rkw1m42B-" data-snack-platform="ios" data-snack-preview="true" data-snack-theme="dark" style="overflow:hidden;background:#212733;border:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,.16);border-radius:4px;height:505px;width:100%"></div>
<script async src="https://snack.expo.io/embed.js"></script>

The above example demonstrates how easy it is to build a map app! We shall share more of these "Snacks" over time and explore React Native (along with Expo) deeper to get the best out of it. We are currently building a Native app with these tools that we shall be launching on the App Store at some point in the near future.... watch this space :-)
