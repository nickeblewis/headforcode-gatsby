## Ok so who are we?

We started off as a one person business, became two and then gained a third person. So we are slowly growing but we are really passionate about the web and what it stands for. We are also huge fans of the coolest of web technologies, so enjoy writing about how we do certain things and hope that helps other developers learn new things.

Clients are very important to us and we are striving to offer a friendly service that is a little bit different to what other consultancy businesses out there offer. So please stop by this blog from time to time to learn more about what we are offering and how we do so.

### Where are we based?

We all live and work in the town of Farnborough which is in Hampshire, UK. So are passionate about working with other local people whom have the same kind of drive as us for creating easy on the eye web products.


### Where do we work?

Well being the web, we offer our services to clients all over the UK and the Globe beyond. Though predominantly working from our office here in Farnborough, we can travel when needed.

### Are we looking to expand?

Over time yes. In fact we would love to create a global team of developers, creative people and writers because our sites are very much about content.
