We love Gatsby and since building this site with the static site generator, we have become somewhat besotted by it and plan to use it for many more projects. We are even thinking of switching some current projects to use it instead. So with this in mind we are going to build a few demo sites to illustrate a few ideas of ours.

We have been watching the development of Gatsby really closely and it is one of the best things happening at the moment in the Web business.
