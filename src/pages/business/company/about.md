## Researching the next idea

Here at HeadForCode we are always looking for new problems to solve that can be solved mostly through the likes of Responsive Web Applications. We are forever learning new ways based on what is considered to be the bleeding edge across the industry. 

We draw upon our background in contracting and having worked with a variety of different companies, of varying sizes and spanning a diverse range of industries.
