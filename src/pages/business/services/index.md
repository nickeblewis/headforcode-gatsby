## What are microservices?

## How we build projects with Microservices

We no longer use dedicated servers for any project but rather a range of different API based services, often called "Microservices". These services are designed to focus on doing individual things and to do them really well because they may cater for all sorts of needs. We will introduce you to those that we use over a series of pages and articles on the kind of possibilities each present.
