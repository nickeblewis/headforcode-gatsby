HeadForCode is a very new site and we shall be developing it quite aggressively over the next few weeks, many articles are planned for the blog. The blog will evolve a great deal in itself. However there is a great deal more to come and we shall keep some things hush hush for the moment or at least until they are closer to being ready to share. We will be introducing some premium courses to the site at some point, we are happy to tell you about that.
