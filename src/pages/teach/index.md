# Learn JAMStack

The HeadForCode site is based on the [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org/) concept, the JAM part of the name stands for JavaScript, APIs and Markup. We will be focusing on how to build JAMStack websites to kick off 2017. We shall be starting with our favourite static site generator, [Phenomic](https://phenomic.io) and shall show you how easy it can be or as complex as can be (if you wish!)

# Hold on what's that?

Ok maybe I have started off explaining things too fast? The web business is a fast place, sometimes we need to slow right down in order to allow people time to comprehend it all. That is our ethos here at HeadForCode, we want to slow things down a bit, so that each day, you can learn something new and we hope - useful.

So walk away from your desk for a bit, give your boss the bird (maybe not) and allow yourselves some learning time... we all need a bit of space and I don't think we are allowed enough sometimes.

Just now I mentioned a few things, the JAM Stack thing, something called Phenomic but I neglected to mention the term, "Static sites". 

So let's begin by taking a look at what static actually means and why it may be a good choice compared to other concepts.

Some could say that we are going back to the old days when we talk about static websites. After all when the web first started, a typical website was based on nothing more than a directory of HTML files. All of those files could only show text and the images came quite some time later. There were no databases, no business logic, no animation, no user interface interaction and indeed everything was far simpler then. Hence the web was static.

The web has evolved a huge amount in the past couple of decades and what started out as a repository for academic papers has become the burgeoning economy that we are all so dependent upon today.

However this has come at a cost. Websites are now of course dynamic, they depend on web and database servers and people now interact with them. A web site has now become a web app. We no longer use desktop apps any longer. We do so much online.

The biggest danger now, more so than ever is hacking, security is now more fragile than ever before. 

Now let us think more about the technical differences between what we refer to as "dynamic" and "static". If you are a seasoned professional who has been coding since the 80's (like me), you may roll your eyes at this point and smirk. Please bear with me on this, we have a younger generation to teach too you know who mostly missed the old days and probably are oblivious to it!!
