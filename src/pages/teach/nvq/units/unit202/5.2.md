## 5.2 State the organisation’s brand or image

- [ ] The headforcode logo is our image 
    - [ ] I have images on the Mac that I shall share with you all
    - [ ] One thing we don't have yet is a "style guide", so let's create one and write about what it is
    - [ ] Then apply the style guide to this site and make sure our logo is displayed in as many places as possible
    - [ ] Where would you consider that logo to appear? Clue: Not just websites....
