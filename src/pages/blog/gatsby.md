description: We have moved this site to GatsbyJS and wow what a fabulous developer experience!
---

GatsbyJS is one of many static site generators or SSGs as they are collectively known but after experimenting with it a bit I have chosen to use it for at least two of our projects, starting with HeadForCode. I had previusly been working on the site using Hugo but was disliking the Go templating system and wanted to return to some sensible React based templating!

So here it is, a lot of work to do still as ever with these projects but what I have so far feels like a great foundation to build upon. I like the fact I can build pages with MarkDown, such as blog posts, where I just want to write stuff up quickly - to pages written as JSX (React). 

I can even mix up static site generation with some elements of dynamic development and shall soon be integrating this site with other services such as GraphCool and many others.

I shall write about my developer experience along the way, as that will help me confirm an understanding of new things learnt and hopefully provide other people with a bit of a helping hand too.
