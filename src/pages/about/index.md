HeadForCode are a small App consultancy based in Farnborough who run an office in the former Town Hall, Ferneberga House. H4C as we like to call ourselves for short was formed out of the 
oiginal company Nick Lewis Ltd. We have been in business for a long time now and H4C was introduced about a year ago to serve a new area of business we are actively pursuing.
