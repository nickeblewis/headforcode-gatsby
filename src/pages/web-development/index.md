I have been building websites for a long time and the methods of doing so have all evolved a great deal. So this has given me a wealth of experience over the years. Nowadays it is certainly one of the most exciting times to be in the business.

I started working as a contractor way back in 2001 originally not long after being made redundant from the finance company I was working for at the time. It was this catalyst that forced me to take a big gamble and go contracting, something that had appealed to me for a couple of years prior. Seems like a long time ago now and it is fantastic that I have been able to work this way for so long.

My contracting business is called "Nick Lewis Ltd" officially but about two years ago, a new name came out of thin air one day and it was "Head for Code" which we now express as "HeadForCode" or sometimes "H4C" internally. It was at this point that my Wife joined the business as a second contractor and she works for one of our clients.

In 2016 we took on our first full-time employee in the form of Dan Davis as an apprentice Web Developer. I ceased to be a one man band and the marketing text switched from being about "me" or "I" to being "Us", "We" and I am excited for the future. There is so much we can do for...
