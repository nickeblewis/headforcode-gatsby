## 15:44 - taking a look through the board

- 16929 - can I get rid of this quickly? Nope can't get this project to run at the moment
- Helped James earlier wit a deployment issue he was having
- Helped Ramana out with timeouts but then realised that this is not something the FE handles rather the back-end services do
- ** 17013 - The EPICC transaction summary page does get truncated, still trying to work out what to do with this **
- ** 16931 - Login button can be triggered by enter key depression which is on Dev. Can this be pushed to T1 = Quang? **
- ** 17024 - Doesn't seem to be occurring any longer, can this be put through testing for more feedback? **
