# Monday 21st August 
## VWO

- Create a test react application so that I have a HTML focument that loads JS run-time
  - Created /c/proj/test-vwo with `create-react-app test-vwo`
  - changed into directory and run `yarn start`
- Will need to deploy to a server on Netlify
- Add my own GTM to it
- Add VWO to that
- Can we create at least two GTM accounts? Prod and Dev/Test
- Prod will have no VWO enabled
- Test/Dev WILL
- Add two buttons to the app
- Experiment with tool that JL uses

## Sign Out

- The pop-up is there but more work is needed around this
- 

# Tuesday 22nd August

## Stand-up
- Yesterday I started to look into VWO and decided that the best way to experiment with this would be to build a prototype application, so as not to cause any issues with our live GTM implementation.
- So that's where I shall continue today 
- Later on I will have some recomendations for how the story for this should be laid out and some idea of how big a piece of work it would be to add to EPICC
- Also more importantly will VWO actually work with EPICC? I have my doubts...

## Planning and retrospective

- TODO

# Wednesday 23rd August

## Todo

- Sprint planning
- Run through Sprint 17 and prep for the planning meeting, quite a lot of UI stuff in there
  - 16580: Can this be closed? It's done innit?
  - 16018: There is no Interactive pop-up?
  - 15987: Bug was fixed on local but observed random behaviour on T environments
  - 15988: Let's task this up with everything that needs changing
  - VWO: Has no story
  - 16360: What is the EPICC letter suite? Is this for email view in browser?
  - Logging (I think Paul our digital trainee touched on this in the retro)
  - Logout should this be in Sprint 17 or later??

- James wants an overview of the FE structure
- Get JL to help me out with configuring the VWO stuff
- Install the 64-bit VSC later when not in the middle of code
