# Monday 21st August 
## VWO

- Create a test react application so that I have a HTML focument that loads JS run-time
  - Created /c/proj/test-vwo with `create-react-app test-vwo`
  - changed into directory and run `yarn start`
- Will need to deploy to a server on Netlify
- Add my own GTM to it
- Add VWO to that
- Can we create at least two GTM accounts? Prod and Dev/Test
- Prod will have no VWO enabled
- Test/Dev WILL
- Add two buttons to the app
- Experiment with tool that JL uses

## Sign Out

- The pop-up is there but more work is needed around this

# Tuesday 22nd August

## Stand-up
- Yesterday I started to look into VWO and decided that the best way to experiment with this would be to build a prototype application, so as not to cause any issues with our live GTM implementation.
- So that's where I shall continue today 
- Later on I will have some recomendations for how the story for this should be laid out and some idea of how big a piece of work it would be to add to EPICC
- Also more importantly will VWO actually work with EPICC? I have my doubts...

## VWO

- Created the test app and loading up GTM into it, that works so far
- Now to create (or find my current) GTM account for which I can configure VWO for

## Planning and retrospective

- TODO
