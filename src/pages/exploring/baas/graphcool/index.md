## Intro
So far we have been working on two projects with [GraphCool](https://graph.cool) that are closely connected and I thought it would be a great idea to write up about how we use it to help other people get to understand it more. GraphCool do have an excellent website with top notch articles, so you can get up and running fast. 

## Related project - RAN

We discovered a great bootstrap project a couple of days ago called [RAN](/exploring/RAN) and this is so called because it is built with React, Apollo and [NextJS](/exploring/next). it just so happens that they have used GraphCool as their backend service for the example that comes bundled with the repository
