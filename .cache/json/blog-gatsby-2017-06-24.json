I had previusly been working on the site using Hugo but was disliking the Go templating system and wanted to return to some sensible React based templating!</p>\n<p>So here it is, a lot of work to do still as ever with these projects but what I have so far feels like a great foundation to build upon. I like the fact I can build pages with MarkDown, such as blog posts, where I just want to write stuff up quickly - to pages written as JSX (React). </p>\n<p>I can even mix up static site generation with some elements of dynamic development and shall soon be integrating this site with other services such as GraphCool and many others.</p>\n<p>I shall write about my developer experience along the way, as that will help me confirm an understanding of new things learnt and hopefully provide other people with a bit of a helping hand too.</p>\n<h3>Resources</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/\">https://www.gatsbyjs.org/</a></p>",
