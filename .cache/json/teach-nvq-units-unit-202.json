The aim of this is to help you think a bit more about the business of the IT industry. We are small, we certainly aren’t corporate but we should still portray a professional image nonetheless. So let’s start to make some progress on this and I will welcome any suggestions you make. There is never a daft question or idea (I’ve been told!).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>5.1 <a href=\"5.1\">List the aims and objectives of the organisation</a></li>\n<li>5.2 <a href=\"5.2\">State the organisation’s brand or image</a></li>\n<li>5.3 <a href=\"5.3\">Identify the organisation’s structure, roles and responsibilities</a></li>\n<li>5.4 <a href=\"5.4\">Identify potential improvements to working practices</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Notes from Nick</h2>\n<p>Tina provided many of the hints above and there are quite a few things we need to help you with here for this part of Unit 202. So I am going to update this page further with links to further information and some new tasks that we can carry out in order to complete 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4 </p>",
