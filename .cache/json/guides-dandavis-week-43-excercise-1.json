If we are not and you only need to do this, if you are in an alternative branch:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code>$ <span class=\"token function\">git</span> checkout Master\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Will make sure we are back in the right place.</p>\n<h2>We are about to pick up on a piece of work</h2>\n<p>Let’s imagine I’ve given you a piece of work to do, it could be an enhancement, a bug fix or something new. Perhaps you have spotted something that isn’t right and you want to change it. In either case, it is a great idea to create a new branch, so lets do that. I am going to give you a little fix to make to this site.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code>$ <span class=\"token function\">git</span> branch <span class=\"token string\">\"removecocacola\"</span>\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>You may have spotted earlier, that on the home page there is a section of text about Coca Cola, now we want to get rid of that, it has nothing to do with H4C!!</p>\n<h2>Launch VSC</h2>\n<p>Launch Visual Studio Code and open up the headforcode project folder under <code>/c/proj/headforcode</code> and using the search tool, look for “coca cola”. The search tool is in the left-hand vertical menu bar along with Explorer, Git, Debug and Extensions. You can also get to it by pressing the following combination of keys CTRL+SHIFT+F.</p>\n<p>It will find two files where “coca cola” is mentioned:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>excercise1.md</li>\n<li>index.js (in src/pages/Homepage)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is the second file we are looking for and underneath it you will see “img src…” listed, double-click on this.</p>\n<p>We want to delete between lines 97 - 106 where you will see an opening and closing <strong>DIV</strong> tag and some blurb about the Coca-Cola company.</p>\n<p>Once deleted, we can then go through the next steps in order to commit your changes to the local repo within your branch, push that to origin, do a pull request, I then review your changes and if approved, they get merged to master and job done!</p>\n<p>NOTE: The second step below may initially fail but Git will help you overcome this, as seen in an earlier lesson</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code>$ <span class=\"token function\">git</span> commit -am <span class=\"token string\">\"I have removed coca-cola\"</span>\n$ <span class=\"token function\">git</span> push \n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Having done the above, go on over to <a href=\"https://github.com/nickeblewis/headforcode\">https://github.com/nickeblewis/headforcode</a> and raise a pull-request</p>\n<p>I think you should be able to follow through with this perfectly fine but as ever, please pop a message in the Disqus area below for help!</p>",
