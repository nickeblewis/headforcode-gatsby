So for example we can get to the Explorer using <strong>CTRL+SHIFT+E</strong> </p>\n<p>Furthermore we can show/hide the bar by using <strong>CTRL+B</strong> at any time, useful for increasing your editing space on the screen or just to visually de-clutter.</p>\n<h2>Exploring the application</h2>\n<p>Since we have been talking about the explorer and we are here mainly to talk about the app we created in the previous article, lets break down the folders and files that the <strong>create_react_app</strong> generated for us…</p>\n<p>Click on each of the items below to read about each and we shall “drill” down deeper each step of the way:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>node_modules</li>\n<li>public</li>\n<li>src</li>\n<li>.gitignore</li>\n<li>README.md</li>\n<li>yarn.lock</li>\n<li>package.json</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We won’t go into a huge amount of detail on the node_modules, .gitignore, README.md or yarn.lock other than to give you an overview for the time being.</p>\n<p>When you run <strong>npm install</strong> it looks at the <em>dependencies</em> listed in your <strong>package.json</strong> file and installs each of these packages. You can find out more about the package.json file here and it plays a huge role in many applications. The outcome of running <strong>npm install</strong> is that it creates the <strong>node_modules</strong> folder and this is why it is always important to run it the first time you set up a project, especially if you have cloned the project from another repsitory elsewhere. It enables developers to pass their code around and makes it easy for us all to get projects up and running with the minimum of fuss.</p>\n<p>The <strong>.gitignore</strong> file allows you to exclude certain files from a Git repsitory and a classic example is the <strong>node_modules</strong> folder we mentioned just now. Why would you want to exlude it? Well, it is a large directory and it is far more efficient to let the user run <strong>npm_install</strong> to grab all of the latest dependencies anyway! There are other files you may wish to exclude and we always suggest that people exclude config files, especially if they include private data such as access keys. Just think by uploading those to Github you are exposing your system to security breaches! The gitignore file is always referred to by <strong>git commit</strong> and ensures any files that shouldn’t be checked in aren’t!</p>",
