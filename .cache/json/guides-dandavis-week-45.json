The new site will start by focussing on events coming up over Christmas, New Year and the beginning of 2017. </p>\n<p>I am not sure how long it will take and I will leave a lot up to you on this to be honest, as I have very little time but do have enough time to give you some ideas.</p>\n<p>We can probably at least add falling background snow on the site, that would be good enough.</p>\n<h2>Skills taught</h2>\n<p>TODO - I need to look at which units this project will cover, probably not all of them but then we have plenty of time in 2017 to pick up on those.</p>\n<h2>Comments below please…</h2>",
