            "html": "<p>Hi Dan, I am just preparing some things for us to begin looking at, as an exercise for you to begin learning some real code and at the same time for me to re-learn some skills I’ve ot worked with for a year or so… shall be fun</p>\n<p>First of all a little history lesson on how I started out in Web development. One of the first things I learnt was how to develop applications using what was at the time called ASP</p>\n<p>(now known as Classic ASP, as it is seldom used now)</p>\n<p>ASP was based on Visual Basic but later came C# as part of the new .NET framework and ASP.NET</p>\n<p>This framework is still going strong and they have just revamped it and have launched ASP.NET Core 1.0 and you can learn more about it at the following address</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/aspnet/core/\">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/aspnet/core/</a></p>\n<p>Have a look at this, some of it is a bit brief and may lead you to asking more questions but that is totally, fine, as I will help you along</p>\n<p>A really good tutorial to start with is the article:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app/start-mvc\">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app/start-mvc</a></p>\n<p>Don’t underestimate .NET, it is colossal but you don’t need to learn it all to get started.</p>\n<p>I would for now just start with the above link, let me know once you’ve got that working and we can move onto the other parts</p>\n<p>Before going too deep, it will be a great idea to learn more about C# itself, the language at the heart of C#. In fact there are two other languages you could use but C# is by far the most commonly used, so makes sense to begin with that.</p>\n<p>We will use these new skills to move on to learning loads more about the Microsoft eco-system and build some apps</p>\n<p>Whats more Umbraco is built with ASP.NET and C#, though not the Core version but I do know the Umbraco team will be building their next version with it…</p>\n<p>I shall paste all of the above into a page on the headforcode site, so that we can share this stuff with Vinay too</p>",
