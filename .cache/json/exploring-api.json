The term is frankly a little bit misleading but what it <em>really</em> means is fairly simple, developers need not worry about servers other than their regular Git workflow. So make your changes, be they bug fixes or enhancements and push them to a particular Repository. Your chosen system does the rest, it magically scales your sevices for you based on demand and or growth. </p>\n<p>This is exciting because it meansthat we can develop software that may not be backed by a VPS server as such, well in fact ironically, it may be, we just don’t need to know. We can build truly agnostic systems that benefit from continuous deployment based on Git commands issued from your Terminal application or your IDE.</p>",
