We will provide you with access and will send an email to you to let you know what the details are.</p>\n<p>Having logged in you will have access to your content but some advanced functions may be hidden from view and only accessible by someone with admin rights. You can contact HeadForCode support if you are ever struggling to find something or not sure how to acheive what you are aiming for.</p>\n<p>The rest of these documentation pages will help guide you through some of the key functionality of Umbraco and how your site specifically works.</p>\n<h2>Logging in</h2>\n<p>To login you must always go to <a href=\"http://yourdomain.com/umbraco\">http://yourdomain.com/umbraco</a> and enter the credentials we provide you with via email.</p>\n<h2>The User Interface</h2>\n<p>First of all it’s very useful to understand how the back office dashboard is laid out and what each section does and then we shall dig deeper into some of the more relevant functionality.</p>\n<p>The screen is split into two main areas, on the left-hand side you will find the “Section Menu” with the top option being content. The majority of the rest of the screen is taken up by the main panel which changes as you cycle through the options in the “Section Menu”. </p>\n<h2>Next steps</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/guides/umbraco/content/\">Working with content</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/guides/umbraco/media/\">Getting to know the Media Library</a></li>\n</ul>",
