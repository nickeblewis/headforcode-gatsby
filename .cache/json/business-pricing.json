If a customer has a tight budget for example we may have to make compromises or suggest that we start with as basic a site we can provide for the money and later add other features when they have more money to spend. This is feasible for an individual (Sole trader) or small business when they are starting out. </p>\n<p>We will soon build a set of ready made sites and apps from which we can use bits to kickstart new projects and ease the process of estimating.</p>\n<p>Generally we will block out time on the calendar depending on what we have booked day-by-day and allow some time for supporting older clients who may have been quiet recently but suddenly need some work done. However we must be careful of promising customers that we shall do work for them straight away, there may be lead times of up to 4-5 weeks at busy times.</p>\n<h2>What do we charge ongoing?</h2>\n<p>Depending on the server costs £30-50 per month or happy to bill in one go at the monthly figure times 12. We can also discuss other options such as a support package in the future which we would bill a great deal more for but will offer the client a lot of regular updates. I have yet to plan that level of service but it is what we call a Service Level Agreement or SLA for short. Normally a contract would need to be signed but in the case of people like hairdressers, we wouldn’t bother with that.</p>\n<h2>What are the different levels of site we offer?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Individual (&#x3C;— best option for your hair dresser friend)</li>\n<li>Small Business</li>\n<li>Bespoke</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What do you get out of the box?</h2>\n<p>(for now this is just for the Individual package, the hair dresser)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Homepage</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>About</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Contact form (that can be adapted to ask whatever you wish)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(dead simple to be honest but it can always be expanded upon)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Google analytics enabled</li>\n<li>SEO - optimised for Google</li>\n<li>Email in conjunction with the web site</li>\n<li>Domain registration</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Farnborough Guide</h1>\n<h2>Standard - Free</h2>\n<p>You get the following: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>An easy web address to remember <a href=\"http://farnboroughguide.com/yourbusinessname\">http://farnboroughguide.com/yourbusinessname</a></li>\n<li>Location - Google map</li>\n<li>Facilities/Services - list of what you offer</li>\n<li>Address and other contact details - email, telephone etc</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Premium Option - from £100 per annum</h2>\n<p>All of the above, plus…</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Custom forms which enable people to make direct enquiries with you from FG</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Photo and video gallery</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Promotion on the FG home page</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>and more to be announced soon</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>SEO</h1>\n<p>How does it work?
