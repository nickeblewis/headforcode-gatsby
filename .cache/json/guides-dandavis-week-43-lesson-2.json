This is important, as otherwise some\nof the steps in this tutorial may not work for you…</p>\n<h2>Let’s talk about Git in more depth</h2>\n<p>Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. In any case I recommend at some point\nvisiting <a href=\"https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1\">https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1</a> to learn more about it or take a look at what they’ve got on CodeAcademy.</p>\n<p>When you cloned the HeadForCode project in <a href=\"/lesson1\">Lesson 1</a> it will have not only created a new folder with your project files in it but it will also have created a Git repository as part of that\nfolder. This is why when you change into the folder using the ‘cd’ command from, let’s say the <strong>proj</strong> folder just above it, the command prompt will look like:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code>/c/proj/headforcode <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>master<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Normal directories don’t show the master bit on the end. It is this piece of information that tells you which brancch you are in, as you may have already guessed, you are currently working on\nthe master. Your local has one of these from the first moment you either manually create the Git repository (using <strong>git init</strong>) locally or you clone a project, as you did in <a href=\"lesson1\">Lesson 1</a>.\nThe remote server, known as “Origin” and effectively our <a href=\"https://github.com/nickeblewis/headforcode\">https://github.com/nickeblewis/headforcode</a> project will also have a matching branch of master.</p>\n<p>So when you run a <strong>git push</strong> command the changes you will have added using <strong>git add .</strong> followed by <strong>git commit -m [message]</strong> will get pushed and merged into the remote branch of the same name.</p>\n<p>This takes a little bit of getting used to but once you’ve done it a few times, it will click and then it becomes easy to use.</p>\n<p>So what we are going to do next is create a new branch but why create branches in the first place?</p>\n<h3>The purpose of branches</h3>\n<p>First up, it is bad practice in most projects where more than one person is working on the same codebase. Hence creating a branch for the piece of work that you are doing makes sense. This is for\ntwo reasons.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You can always switch between your branch and the master, useful if you work isn’t going quite right and you want to switch to the “working version” to compare</li>\n<li>One person may be working on re-styling the site based on a company re-brand and the other may be fixing some urgent bugs. You can work independently of eachother without the worry of causing conflicts</li>\n<li>You may be working on fixing one thing and then are asked to work on something else, you can switch back to the master branch, leaving your incomplete work intact and safe where it is.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These are just some of the great reasons for branching. In our case, it will simply be so that we can both work on the same project and not worry about treading on eachothers toes. </p>\n<h3>Lets crack on and create a branch</h3>\n<p>So to create a branch, make sre that you are in the main folder of the headforcode project:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code>$ <span class=\"token function\">cd</span> /c/proj/headforcode\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Let’s do a quick status check on our git repository</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code>$ <span class=\"token function\">git</span> status\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>This will inform you that <strong>Your branch is up-to-date with ‘origin/master’.</strong> and that is to be expected, as we haven’t yet done anything with the project, so far we have cloned it from GitHub,\ninstalled the NPM modules and started it to check that it runs.</p>\n<p>Now we are going to create our first branch and names should be all lower-case, have no spaces etc:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code>$ <span class=\"token function\">git</span> branch <span class=\"token string\">\"mynewbranch\"</span>\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>You should see a message saying <strong>Switched to a new branch ‘mynewbranch’</strong> at this stage and that is great.</p>\n<p>So at this moment in time, your new branch only exists on your machine and we should make some minor changes to a file using Visual Studio Code to see what happens. </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Let’s launch Visual Studio Code via Windows and then open your <strong>/c/proj/headforcode</strong> project folder.</li>\n<li>Find the README.md file in the root directory </li>\n<li>Make an edit to it, just add your name somewhere or something like that, you will see I added my name at the bottom earlier!!</li>\n<li>Now go back to your Terminal and run the following commands one after the other</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code>$ <span class=\"token function\">git</span> add <span class=\"token keyword\">.</span>\n$ <span class=\"token function\">git</span> commit -m <span class=\"token string\">\"Added my name to the file\"</span>\n$ <span class=\"token function\">git</span> push\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>That last command will have displayed a fatal error and this is correct because there is no matching branch on the origin server just yet, we haven’t created one yet and in fact Git will have\nprovided you with some help, the command they suggest is exactly what you need to run next</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code>$ <span class=\"token function\">git</span> push --set-upstream origin mynewbranch\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>NOTE: Future pushes to this branch need only be run using <strong>git push</strong>, you only need to use <strong>—set-upstream</strong> once for new branches.</p>\n<p>This time you will see some positive feedback being output to the Terminal as Git pushes your branch up to Github, so a quick <strong>git status</strong> should reveal that your branch is up-to-date with\n<strong>origin/nicksnewbranch</strong>, nothing to commit, working tree clean.</p>\n<p>Now is a good time to demonstrate what happens when you switch branches</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code>$ <span class=\"token function\">git</span> checkout master\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>If you have Visual Studio Code open still, you will have noticed your changes vanish!!! Oh no!!! This is fine, it is ok, don’t worry! Remember the changes you made were to the other branch and not the\nmaster. If you now type in and run:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code>$ <span class=\"token function\">git</span> checkout mynewbranch\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>You will see that your changes are back and I think this demonstrates the point of branches, you can work on different versions of a codebase (what we call a project of code) and not actually lose anything.\nIt also demonstrates one other thing I have not mentioned yet - the fact that you don’t need to create loads of different directories for different versions of a project. Your <strong>headforcode</strong> folder contains all of the branches, it is almost as if Git gives your laptops folder special powers!</p>\n<h3>Let’s see what is on Github</h3>\n<p>Go to <a href=\"http://www.github.com/nickeblewis/headforcode\">http://www.github.com/nickeblewis/headforcode</a> (and you may need to login with the account you created last week). You will now be viewing the repository. If you look just beneath the description\nyou will see a row of tabs, commits, branch(es), releases and contributors. You should see that we have two branches and in any case, there will always be at least one branch, as the master is always present. It is created automatically for us when creating the repo.</p>\n<p>That will do for now, in the next lesson we will learn how to create a “Pull Request” and talk about “Code Reviews” which we shall use extensively as part of teaching and also in actual projects. In the contracts I do, most companies insist on this process and it is a good one to follow.</p>",
