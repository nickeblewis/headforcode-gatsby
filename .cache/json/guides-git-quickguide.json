If using VSC, you will also see this piece of info displayed in the bottom left-hand corner of the application. There is also the branch command:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code>$ <span class=\"token function\">git</span> branch\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>This displays the branch you are in, that is marked by an asterix and it will show othere branches you have available to you.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code>$ <span class=\"token function\">git</span> branch --all\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Does the same thing but also shows you the remote branches that are available.</p>\n<h2>What is my status?</h2>\n<p>Git status provides you with information on the current status of your git repository and is a command you should use often. I often use it as a sanity check after committing changes and so on.</p>\n<h2>Typical steps to follow frequently</h2>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code>$ <span class=\"token function\">git</span> status\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>If you have no changes pending, you should see something like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code>On branch master\nYour branch is up-to-date with origin/master\nnothing to commit, working tree clean\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>That is perfect because, you can see that you have nothing to pull from the origin server (aka the remote Git repository). </p>\n<p>What if you see something different here? You might be informed that your branch is either ahead or behind by so many commits.</p>\n<p>If you are behind and to be honest, I do this anyway even if my status seems to be clean and up-to-date.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code>$ <span class=\"token function\">git</span> pull\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>This will always retrieve any changes that may or may not exist from origin/master, tyoically things I have been working on. I will do the same my end too if I know you’ve made changes.</p>\n<h2>When is it right to branch?</h2>\n<p>Whilst yoy can of course just dive in and make changes to the master branch, it is generally not the best thing to do. What I recommend we do, is to make use of branches when starting on a new piece of work. It helps isolate what I am doing from your work in progress and vice versa. It also means we have an opportunity to review eachothers work before we merge it into master.</p>\n<p>You can branch from any branch but it is always best to do so from the master, if that makes sense.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code>$ <span class=\"token function\">git</span> checkout -b <span class=\"token string\">\"mynewbranch\"</span> \n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Will create a new branch on your computer, not on the remote machine (origin) to start with. There are various ways you can do this from within VSC too. We will cover that at some point.</p>\n<h2>Committing and pushing your changes</h2>\n<p>Once you have made changes, you can commit them to your branch.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code>$ <span class=\"token function\">git</span> add --all\n$ <span class=\"token function\">git</span> commit -m <span class=\"token string\">\"whatever message you like but make it descriptive\"</span>\n$ <span class=\"token function\">git</span> push\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>The above commands add all changes to what is known as the “staging area” of the repository. They will remain there until you commit them. Every commit is given a unique reference ID that can be used later for more complex git tasks if needs be, such as cancelling an older change any time in the future, something we call “reverting”.</p>\n<p>The push will transfer your changes to the origin server.</p>\n<h2>Pull requests, code reviews and merges</h2>\n<p>You should then let me know that you have pushed some changes to origin and this is where I can review them. It goes both ways, you can code review mine too. I will then be able to generate a pull-request, check the code, maybe make suggestions for alterations and when we are both happy…</p>\n<p>We merge.</p>\n<p>The merge combines it all into the origin master branch</p>\n<h2>Switching branches</h2>\n<p>You can then switch back to master, to pull down all of the new merged changes</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code>$ <span class=\"token function\">git</span> checkout master\n$ <span class=\"token function\">git</span> pull\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>We both do that and we are then both in sync with eachother ready to tackle the next piece of work.</p>",
