We shall discuss the services that this company provides now and what it’s plans are for the future. We also talk at length about the tools and processes we use to achieve our goals.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"/courses/javascript\">Courses</a></h2>\n<p>I am putting together material that will help guide you through the topics you will learn over the year. I shall release them bit by bit, simply because I am writing them as we go along.</p>\n<p>Dan, I know that you have been going through CodeAcademy and have already learnt a lot about HTML and CSS. We shall begin by taking a look at NodeJS and how all of these things tie together and work in harmony.</p>\n<p>So let’s begin by learning about: <a href=\"/courses/series/javascript\">JavaScript</a></p>\n<h2><a href=\"units\">Units</a></h2>\n<p>The following pages highlight the units we have chosen for this NVQ course and on each page you will find notes explaining what topics we will be covering as part of our day-to-day work at Nick Lewis Ltd (HeadForCode). I hope that you both (Dan and Vinay) find this useful.</p>\n<p>Learn more about the units we have chosen: <a href=\"/nvq/units\">The Units we are covering</a></p>\n<h2>Any questions?</h2>\n<p>If you have any questions about any of the above, please feel free to discuss below.
