GraphCool do have an excellent website with top notch articles, so you can get up and running fast. </p>\n<h2>Related project - RAN</h2>\n<p>We discovered a great bootstrap project a couple of days ago called <a href=\"/exploring/RAN\">RAN</a> and this is so called because it is built with React, Apollo and <a href=\"/exploring/next\">NextJS</a>. it just so happens that they have used GraphCool as their backend service for the example that comes bundled with the repository</p>",
