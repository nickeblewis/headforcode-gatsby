We hope you find something here of interest and look forward to chatting with you in the future.</p>\n<h2>Where are we?</h2>\n<p>We are based in Farnborough at the former Town Hall, Ferneberga House, right next door to the Alexandra Road Post Office depot. You are welcome to come and see us but it’s often best to pop us an email first to make sure we are about and aslo so that we can get biscuits. What kind of meeting would it be without those!</p>\n<h2>What we do?</h2>\n<p>We could just say that we build web and mobile apps, whilst that is a little bit vague in many ways, it is what we do! </p>\n<ul>\n<li>We take on a lot of contract work which means we often work with big companies for a few months at a time, sometimes on site and from our own premises in Farnborough. Right now we are working with Premium Credit Ltd on a project that enables insurance brokers to process their customers’ premiums</li>\n<li>We have in the past worked with The AA, Transport for London, Zurich Insurance, Save the Children and others</li>\n<li>We are currently developing a product called Farnborough Guide which is going to be a platform for helping businesses promote themselves to local people. It will be more in depth about the topics it covers compared to other sites</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Who are we?</h2>\n<p>There are three of us, we are small and proud of being so. Two Directors, one of whom is myself, Nick Lewis and I play a kind of CEO/CTO role. Tina Lewis (my Wife) who takes care of the HR side of things and is also currently engaged in a long term contract. Dan Davis who is our newest member of the team. He helps us build web apps and provides a very dry sense of humour to the mix… In fact we are all pretty daft when it comes down to it!</p>\n<h2>Why come to us?</h2>\n<p>We have a “can do” attitude but at the same time would also be honest if we feel a project is beyong our scope.</p>\n<h2>What are we looking for right now?</h2>\n<p>So here is the call to action for you as it were. We are busy right now which is great but in the Spring time this year we are going to have some capacity as they say in the business. We will be able to take new work on around then and we are prompting people to get in touch now with their needs.</p>\n<h3>What would be our ideal project</h3>\n<p>Well we are working on one or two off our own backs and they are coming along well but we would love to build some business focussed web apps for people. Totally bespoke products that we can continue to support for you for many years. We are looking at not just developing new applications but also at building new B2B relationships around the area.</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-6b5b7a707bff1204d3a98b358efd1f7c-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypants","value":""},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-313b58b218db7953c809407f2bf74c0d-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypants","value":"<h2>Active</h2>\n<h3>Our website</h3>\n<p>The homepage should focus a bit more on our key areas of profitable business</p>\n<ul>\n<li>APIs/Microservices</li>\n<li>Consuming API to generate web documents</li>\n<li>Integration between front-end and bac-end services using loopback</li>\n<li>JamStack</li>\n<li>\n<p>Build UIs for your back-ends or hardware devices</p>\n<h3>Farnborough Guide</h3>\n<p>Available both as a web app and mobile app</p>\n<h3>Mapugo</h3>\n<h2>Non-active</h2>\n<h2>Bookavation</h2>\n</li>\n</ul>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-9a3d78d9d587fec889a14e190435a7c3-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypants","value":"<p>Working on getting my head around EPICC again today!</p>\n<p>onDownloadCsv.js</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Should this need a store?

We shall be starting with our favourite static site generator, <a href=\"https://phenomic.io\">Phenomic</a> and shall show you how easy it can be or as complex as can be (if you wish!)</p>\n<h1>Hold on what’s that?</h1>\n<p>Ok maybe I have started off explaining things too fast? The web business is a fast place, sometimes we need to slow right down in order to allow people time to comprehend it all. That is our ethos here at HeadForCode, we want to slow things down a bit, so that each day, you can learn something new and we hope - useful.</p>\n<p>So walk away from your desk for a bit, give your boss the bird (maybe not) and allow yourselves some learning time… we all need a bit of space and I don’t think we are allowed enough sometimes.</p>\n<p>Just now I mentioned a few things, the JAM Stack thing, something called Phenomic but I neglected to mention the term, “Static sites”. </p>\n<p>So let’s begin by taking a look at what static actually means and why it may be a good choice compared to other concepts.</p>\n<p>Some could say that we are going back to the old days when we talk about static websites. After all when the web first started, a typical website was based on nothing more than a directory of HTML files. All of those files could only show text and the images came quite some time later. There were no databases, no business logic, no animation, no user interface interaction and indeed everything was far simpler then. Hence the web was static.</p>\n<p>The web has evolved a huge amount in the past couple of decades and what started out as a repository for academic papers has become the burgeoning economy that we are all so dependent upon today.</p>\n<p>However this has come at a cost. Websites are now of course dynamic, they depend on web and database servers and people now interact with them. A web site has now become a web app. We no longer use desktop apps any longer. We do so much online.</p>\n<p>The biggest danger now, more so than ever is hacking, security is now more fragile than ever before. </p>\n<p>Now let us think more about the technical differences between what we refer to as “dynamic” and “static”. If you are a seasoned professional who has been coding since the 80’s (like me), you may roll your eyes at this point and smirk. Please bear with me on this, we have a younger generation to teach too you know who mostly missed the old days and probably are oblivious to it!!</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-0c67dfc7c9502096cabcb6f0a03686c1-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypants","value":"<h1>Welcome…</h1>\n<p>I am now starting to put together a more stuctured series of weekly courses that will focus on various things to help you learn, to complement CodeAcademy.

I found a whole bunch of tools such as Jekyll, Hugo, Gatsby, Metalsmith and Phenomic. All of which abandon the traditional PHP server and MySql database in favour of plain old static files. Once I had cottoned on to the concept, I was totally hooked, why hadn’t I entertained this method before? Well of course I had back in the old fashioned web days when everything was based on static HTML files!! Why have we gone back to old skool? Have we really gone back to the 90’s or has Happy House grown up and become Jazz?</p>\n<h2>Out with the old</h2>\n<p>I run a website simply called nicklewis.net and it is a classic Wordpress job which I have been running for domkeys of years now. However it is prone to being hit by XML-RPC attacks and it needs to be updated frequently for the sake of security patches. Wordpress is great for what it does but much like other PHP based system, Drupal for example, it is quite hefty too. I mean to say that I prefer lean and mean code any day. I also like to “know the code” even if it isn’t entirely my own. Let’s face it these days, we all rely on “git clone” from the get go and adapt it to our own needs. So whilst mulling over the best solutions for our new website headforcode.com I took the brave decision to throw away the old tools and buy some shiny new ones… metaphorically speaking of course!</p>\n<h2>Embracing the new</h2>\n<p>I spent a considerable length of time hunting for the right tools to use. I tried them all out and had fun doing so but I was keen to be able to use React, so my hunt came to an end, pretty much as soon as I cast my eyes for the first time upon Phenomic. It was the right tool for me and is supported by an active community of developers too. Their website is also really good with a great showcase page that led me to discovering some other great things at the time. I must admit that I used Serveless as a guideline for this site.</p>\n<h2>For the love of Markdown</h2>\n<p>One of the biggest things I love about Phenomic is that you can write your articles (or content) using Markdown. I for example wrote this article on a flight from London to Malta. I have no internet here at 33,000 feet but I can save what I’m writing to my Surface Pro 4. I can later commit my code and then push it to Github. </p>\n<p>Having pushed, some internet magic happens, as a webhook fires up Netlify’s deployment processes, headforcode is re-built and pushed onto their super-fact CDN network. </p>\n<p>It is so cool that I can write articles using the same code editor I use for writing my Javascript. I shall write more about my processes in future articles because I am a massive (obssessive even) fan of such things.</p>\n<h2>Better security</h2>\n<p>I would also like to point out one of the biggest beneefits of this whole approach and that is security. Having no database nor web server means there is precious little opportunity for hackers to get into the system to wreak havoc. It is pretty much a closed door. This is largely due to the fact that everything is built up-front and deployed as static files.</p>\n<h2>Don’t worry, Be API</h2>\n<p>How do we handle search? At the time of writing this article, HeadForCode.com does not yet have a search facility but we will soon. We are planning to use Algolia. How the heck does it work though, if we have no database or any other form of normal server? The answer is, we use webhooks to trigger an index of the site instead. So when we push to GitHub, we also trigger a -re-index of the entire site. We will be adding a search widget to the site that then queries the index via an API service. It is fast and also places less overhead on the website itself, we let someone else take care of that for us.</p>\n<p>We can use APIs for making our site dynamic and here are a few thoughts that we have on that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Content could be delivered using a service like Prismic, Contentful and others</li>\n<li>We can sell things using services like Snipcart</li>\n<li>In fact many other API based services will work</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We shall be exploring the options available over the coming weeks and providing some tutorial content on how you can introduce them to your own projects :-)</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-fb175bf22c66200daae44cda70b27ec0-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypants","value":"<h1>The plan for 2017</h1>\n<h2>Contracting</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>PCL contract ends on the 28th April</li>\n<li>\n<p>Taking a break from contracting during May in order to focus on mentoring Dan and ramping up production on our own projects</p>\n<h2>What can I launch with soon?</h2>\n</li>\n<li>FG App</li>\n<li>\n<p>Mapugo</p>\n<h2>What can we roll out later?</h2>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>FG website</p>\n<h2>Services</h2>\n</li>\n<li>Consider what we are great at doing and offer those things as services</li>\n<li>GraphQL API data</li>\n<li>Charge for APIs</li>\n<li>CMS such as Umbraco</li>\n<li>\n<p>Static site CMS such as how this site is built</p>\n<h2>Pricing</h2>\n</li>\n<li>We essentally have a bottom line that matches contract day rates to meet</li>\n<li>\n<p>Will be hard</p>\n<h2>Promotion and marketing</h2>\n</li>\n<li>This website needs to be active</li>\n<li>We need to offer our mentoring services</li>\n<li>\n<p>Engage with customers and our audience (Freecom is a good route into this)</p>\n<h2>Articles and blogging</h2>\n</li>\n<li>Engage with social media such as LinkedIn and Wordpress</li>\n<li>Write about the emerging Tech we are passionate about, GraphQL for example</li>\n</ul>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-386fd693491152d3f1a5920c96d24815-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypants","value":"<h2>The gist of it is this</h2>\n<p>HeadForCode is a new thing, we have been quietly chipping away at the idea now for about a year and the website has been something of a background project for awhile. We have also been talking about the idea behind it with various people and with the aim of creating a small team to help develop the concept further. How did it come about? What exactly is HeadForCode?</p>\n<p>Let us first talk about <strong>Code</strong> itself…</p>\n<p>I am a firm believer that the world in which we live is not going to sit still for long and if anything, it is going to get a lot more <em>fidgety</em> in the next few years. If you are a “Coder” you are going to have a very interesting time because I feel that many of the things we once considered to be the norm not so long ago, will become anything but. I also believe that more and more people will become involved in <strong>Code</strong> but maybe not in the traditional sense. I think everyone will soon be getting their hands dirty and building their own things. We are already seeing a proliferation of “build your own site without knowing anything about programming” services popping up left right and center, such as Wix and Squarespace for example. A lot of people have asked me about what people in my business will do when systems become able to write their own code, relegating developers to the dole queue? No that won’t happen because we will still be needed to build such systems in the first place… as I say there are a lot off interesting things bubbling away across the World that will reshape the industry. It has evolved massively since the late 80’s when I was learning to write programs in machine-code, assembly language and C++.</p>\n<p>So we at HeadForCode we focus on research, mentoring and consultancy. We explore new ideas of how you can use code to improve the way you as an individual or as a business get the level best out of your technology, no matter whether we are talking about the web or mobile. We consider ourselves to have a “good head for code” much the same as a mathmetician has a good head for numbers or a historian can recall the dates of famous battles. You get the gist.</p>\n<p>Knowledge is all very well but there is no point keeping it locked in our heads and that is why we like to mentor people and help them learn. To level up as we like to say.</p>\n<p>We shall be running a number of online courses through this website.</p>\n<h2>The website</h2>\n<p>We like to be revolutionary here and when it came to building this website, we first considered the normal paths that we could follow, we thought about using Wordpress or Drupal. We then thought again and hav opted to take a very different path by using the so called JAM Stack as our approach</p>\n<h2>The team</h2>\n<p>We operate out of an office in Farnborough, Hampshire, England. Just two of us. We have a third person too on the board of Directors but she is working on a different project at the current time. We plan to expand when we need to and we will probably only ever work with freelancers who could be working anywhere in the UK and beyond. In the future we may even stop renting office space and instead switch to a system by which we work from anywhere, wherever we are at any particular time.</p>\n<p>My partner in crime is a young apprentice by the name of Dan Davis, he is learning fast and has a fabulous aptitude for the technology that we are working with.</p>\n<h2>Our next steps</h2>\n<p>We are building this site using what we call “modern methods” but some of them may not sound that way, as we shall explain in the next article in this blog, keep your eyes peeled..</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-8385381ec1659c21b59acd6e53b5c3c4-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypants","value":"<h1>Our Projects</h1>\n<h2>Website ideas</h2>\n<h3>Farnborough Guide</h3>\n<p>We are developing both a mobile app and a website with a GraphQL backend powered by GraphCool, so we will be building some lambda functions.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cloudinary</li>\n<li>GraphCool</li>\n<li>Auth0</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Mapugo</h3>\n<p>This project has begun and is based on the FG codebase</p>\n<h3>Nfolio</h3>\n<h3>nicklewis.tech</h3>\n<h3>nicklewis.photo</h3>\n<h3>headfortech.com</h3>\n<h3>plantagain.com</h3>\n<h3>propellercam.co.uk</h3>\n<h3>tutl.io</h3>\n<h2>Technologies</h2>\n<h3>IoT</h3>\n<h3>Automation</h3>\n<h2>General research</h2>\n<p>Looking constantly at possibilities plus I believe that the above projects will in themselves lead to other ideas and other fragments of code that we could develop further to be able to offer people more diverse services.</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-9dea0b471f906a7484ecac47bd03370d-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypants","value":"<h1>Websites/Apps</h1>\n<h2>What do we charge upfront?</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Daily Fee</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Junior Developer</td>\n<td>£200</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Senior Developer</td>\n<td>£300</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Team of 2 Developers</td>\n<td>£450</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>A small site may be taken from a ready-made template, in which case it is possible to get a site up and running within 2-3 days on average. If a customer has a tight budget for example we may have to make compromises or suggest that we start with as basic a site we can provide for the money and later add other features when they have more money to spend. This is feasible for an individual (Sole trader) or small business when they are starting out. </p>\n<p>We will soon build a set of ready made sites and apps from which we can use bits to kickstart new projects and ease the process of estimating.</p>\n<p>Generally we will block out time on the calendar depending on what we have booked day-by-day and allow some time for supporting older clients who may have been quiet recently but suddenly need some work done. However we must be careful of promising customers that we shall do work for them straight away, there may be lead times of up to 4-5 weeks at busy times.</p>\n<h2>What do we charge ongoing?</h2>\n<p>Depending on the server costs £30-50 per month or happy to bill in one go at the monthly figure times 12. We can also discuss other options such as a support package in the future which we would bill a great deal more for but will offer the client a lot of regular updates.

I thought it would be good to put together a series of articles on how to build up the basics and we can then build upon those and get as advanced as we wish… the app must be easy for people to use, funky and fun at the same time. We can later use these skills to convert more of the Farnborough Guide site to this way of working. </p>\n<p>Lets take it all a step at a time.</p>\n<p>I am basing this series of exercises on <a href=\"https://www.learnapollo.com\">Learn Apollo</a> but adapting their code, their text into something way more relevant to what we are doing here. So by all means have flick through their pages but don’t follow the tutorials there, we shall focus on them our own way. Yeah?

The Act sets out the general duties which employers have towards employees and members of the public, and employees have to themselves and to each other.\nWhat the law requires here is what good management and common sense would lead individuals and organisations to do anyway: that is, identify risks and take sensible measures to tackle them.\nHealth and safety legislation impacts not only on those who are employed at work, but on visitors, bystanders and customers who may be affected by actions of those engaged in work activities.\nHealth and safety legislation is subject to constant review, and new legislation is introduced on a regular basis. This constant change must be monitored by organisations and individuals to identify actions required to remain compliant. Interpretation of the legislation may also be modified as a result of case law or other legal guidance.</p>\n<h2>Assessment methodology</h2>\n<p>This unit is assessed in the workplace.

Staltz has been developing an interesting project called CycleJS that is based\non the philosophy that applications are just IO with inputs typically being interactions\nvia keyboard, mouse etc and the outputs being typically UI such as DOM. The whole\nidea gels well with the Observables. CycleJS revolves around Observables and hence the\nname what goes in, comes back out and back around again.</p>\n<p>Observables being based on inputs and outputs are powerful because of how you can\ntransform and control the flow of data/information going through the observable.</p>\n<p>A simple example of this transformation and control could be a reaction to a click that\nwill increase a count after 200ms</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-none\"><code>// With plain JS\nlet count = 0;\ndocument.querySelector('#button').addEventListener('click', () => {\nsetTimeout(() => ++count, 200);\n});\n\n// With Observable\nObservable.fromEvent(document.querySelector('#button'), 'click')\n.delay(200)\n.scan(count => ++count, 0);</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>An observable approach means more expressive code, felxible and you can achieve\nsome amazing stuff with little code.</p>\n<p>Pure functions are simply input and outputs</p>\n<p>A pure function doesn’t depend on and doesn’t modify the states of variables out of its scope.</p>\n<p>Concretely, that means a pure function always returns the same result given same parameters. Its execution doesn’t depend on the state of the system.</p>\n<p>Pure functions are a pillar of functional programming.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nicoespeon.com/en/2015/01/pure-functions-javascript/\">http://www.nicoespeon.com/en/2015/01/pure-functions-javascript/</a></p>\n<p>This makes your code less error prone and it is easier to test. But the question to answer is: “How can you actually build an application with this approach?”</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-5c7d0a2d163df8f310fb4c208fc580d9-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypants","value":"<p>Discovered whilst struggling with Fetch on the PAP project</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/github/fetch\">https://github.com/github/fetch</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/whatwg/fetch\">https://github.com/whatwg/fetch</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://visionmedia.github.io/superagent/\">https://visionmedia.github.io/superagent/</a></li>\n</ul>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-1b1ca6bc76cc55461c50b5eece95b029-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypants","value":"<p>In this section we aim to write about as many of the tehnologies and services that are available to us today, though we may tend to venture down a slightly biased path at times.

If using VSC, you will also see this piece of info displayed in the bottom left-hand corner of the application. There is also the branch command:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code>$ <span class=\"token function\">git</span> branch\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>This displays the branch you are in, that is marked by an asterix and it will show othere branches you have available to you.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code>$ <span class=\"token function\">git</span> branch --all\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Does the same thing but also shows you the remote branches that are available.</p>\n<h2>What is my status?</h2>\n<p>Git status provides you with information on the current status of your git repository and is a command you should use often. I often use it as a sanity check after committing changes and so on.</p>\n<h2>Typical steps to follow frequently</h2>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code>$ <span class=\"token function\">git</span> status\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>If you have no changes pending, you should see something like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code>On branch master\nYour branch is up-to-date with origin/master\nnothing to commit, working tree clean\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>That is perfect because, you can see that you have nothing to pull from the origin server (aka the remote Git repository). </p>\n<p>What if you see something different here? You might be informed that your branch is either ahead or behind by so many commits.</p>\n<p>If you are behind and to be honest, I do this anyway even if my status seems to be clean and up-to-date.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code>$ <span class=\"token function\">git</span> pull\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>This will always retrieve any changes that may or may not exist from origin/master, tyoically things I have been working on. I will do the same my end too if I know you’ve made changes.</p>\n<h2>When is it right to branch?</h2>\n<p>Whilst yoy can of course just dive in and make changes to the master branch, it is generally not the best thing to do. What I recommend we do, is to make use of branches when starting on a new piece of work. It helps isolate what I am doing from your work in progress and vice versa. It also means we have an opportunity to review eachothers work before we merge it into master.</p>\n<p>You can branch from any branch but it is always best to do so from the master, if that makes sense.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code>$ <span class=\"token function\">git</span> checkout -b <span class=\"token string\">\"mynewbranch\"</span> \n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Will create a new branch on your computer, not on the remote machine (origin) to start with. There are various ways you can do this from within VSC too. We will cover that at some point.</p>\n<h2>Committing and pushing your changes</h2>\n<p>Once you have made changes, you can commit them to your branch.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code>$ <span class=\"token function\">git</span> add --all\n$ <span class=\"token function\">git</span> commit -m <span class=\"token string\">\"whatever message you like but make it descriptive\"</span>\n$ <span class=\"token function\">git</span> push\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>The above commands add all changes to what is known as the “staging area” of the repository. They will remain there until you commit them. Every commit is given a unique reference ID that can be used later for more complex git tasks if needs be, such as cancelling an older change any time in the future, something we call “reverting”.</p>\n<p>The push will transfer your changes to the origin server.</p>\n<h2>Pull requests, code reviews and merges</h2>\n<p>You should then let me know that you have pushed some changes to origin and this is where I can review them. It goes both ways, you can code review mine too. I will then be able to generate a pull-request, check the code, maybe make suggestions for alterations and when we are both happy…</p>\n<p>We merge.</p>\n<p>The merge combines it all into the origin master branch</p>\n<h2>Switching branches</h2>\n<p>You can then switch back to master, to pull down all of the new merged changes</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code>$ <span class=\"token function\">git</span> checkout master\n$ <span class=\"token function\">git</span> pull\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>We both do that and we are then both in sync with eachother ready to tackle the next piece of work.</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-c4173e94b366549fb61c8d4a899f48d7-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypants","value":"<h2>What is FRP?</h2>\n<p>The simple answer to this question is that there is no simple answer.

In fact there are two other languages you could use but C# is by far the most commonly used, so makes sense to begin with that.</p>\n<p>We will use these new skills to move on to learning loads more about the Microsoft eco-system and build some apps</p>\n<p>Whats more Umbraco is built with ASP.NET and C#, though not the Core version but I do know the Umbraco team will be building their next version with it…</p>\n<p>I shall paste all of the above into a page on the headforcode site, so that we can share this stuff with Vinay too</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-53670430eee298beffef8ddde8629779-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypants","value":"<p>TODO</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-c71e9e524a00dae0930ba2ccb158c527-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypants","value":"<p>TODO</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-989f54a812799a3c42775947f4847f33-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypants","value":"<h1>Overview of the project and engineering decisions</h1>\n<p>I am now starting to put together a more stuctured series of weekly courses that will focus on various things to help you learn, to complement CodeAcademy.

The build process constantly <em>watches</em> for changes as they occcur.</p>\n<p>We will explore this more in future pages here on HeadForCode.</p>\n<h3>Now let’s get to know React better</h3>\n<p>This exercise should have given you a quick insight into how you can create a React app from scratch and we shall look next at expanding it by adding further components to the project and structuring the app properly.</p>\n<p>The next steps will be to move on to the following topics and exercises:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"how\">How does the basic app work?</a></li>\n<li>Connecting to a GraphQL data service</li>\n</ul>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-b33358cd07df366a81a345e704e4476e-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypants","value":"<p>TODO - write about how we use front end technologies for this website</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-cea3e6a849bce45359c71ed771213ffd-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypants","value":"<p>Welcome etc!</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-b5b44832d2cc3410d28632e3e7e19740-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypants","value":"<p>TODO - sendgrid writeup</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-5ce703d4f5710f57169a130bcaa0df1b-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypants","value":"<p>NOTES</p>\n<p>httpstatusdogs</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-18c1198181d47db16c8d352cff60c3a3-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypants","value":"<p>TODO: Write about Yarn</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-5cfcc1b2ad7ffaf5530c5f47d7393bab-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypants","value":"<p>This is a placeholder page for the Surrey IT project or what was to be now not…</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-787d534836289a695d0d73d4cfaadd98-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypants","value":"<h2>Essential steps</h2>\n<p>First of all clone the repo:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit\">https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit</a></p>\n<p>Then follow the steps tom install the chrome extension</p>\n<h2>The following is probably optional</h2>\n<p>Then install </p>\n<p>npm i redux-cli -g</p>\n<p>Then:</p>\n<p>$ redux g form ContactForm</p>\n<p>See what happens!!</p>\n<p>Note that the .reduxrc file looks like this and need not be changed.</p>\n<p>{\n“sourceBase”:“src”,\n“testBase”:“tests”,\n“smartPath”:“containers”,\n“dumbPath”:“components”,\n“fileCasing”:“pascal”\n}</p>\n<p>I also ran </p>\n<p>$ redux g form LoginForm</p>\n<h2>Adding something new</h2>\n<p>I have added login which is actually just another counter with it’s own independent\nstate to the original</p>\n<p>src/components/Header/Header.js</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Added a new link to the nav which points to the /login route</li>\n</ul>\n<p>src/components/Login/index.js</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Module connection</li>\n</ul>\n<p>src/components/Login/Login.js</p>\n<ul>\n<li>React component for login</li>\n</ul>\n<p>src/components/Login/Login.scss</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Modular CSS for the login component</li>\n</ul>\n<p>src/routes/index.js</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Added login to the React router</li>\n</ul>\n<p>src/routes/Login/index.js</p>\n<ul>\n<li>added to reducers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>src/routes/Login/containers/LoginContainer.js</p>\n<ul>\n<li>?????</li>\n</ul>\n<p>src/routes/Login/modules/login.js</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Actions LOGIN_INCREMENT which takes a value of +1 or -1</li>\n</ul>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-eee7fd265888bde5a0079f8e2192aa45-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypants","value":"<h2>The basics</h2>\n<p>You can get to your public site via <a href=\"http://yourdomain.com\">http://yourdomain.com</a> and you can access your website’s backoffice via <a href=\"http://yourdomain.com/umbraco\">http://yourdomain.com/umbraco</a> at which point you will be prompted for a login.

Our main aim is to talk about the database, how does it work and to demonstrate an understanding of this area to Vinay on the day of his visit.</p>\n<h3>0: Introduction to the project</h3>\n<p>Farnborough Guide is a new project we are embarking on this year that will help provide people with information on what is going on in their town and things they can do. The project is likely to become quite big over time, we have a lot of ideas for it.</p>\n<p>One aspect of the site will be a walks page/section that will feature a number of self-guided tours around the town. Many of them will have a theme, such as aviation being a good example. Some will just be good ideas for fitness and could be adapted as running or cycling routes.</p>\n<p>We could tell you more but for now, we want to talk about databases and how such a site is designed from the ground up.</p>\n<p>I have been helping Nick design and develop the database recently and here is how it all comes together.</p>\n<h3>1: Start by showing Vinay a diagram</h3>\n<p><strong>TODO: We shall sketch out a database diagram on the whiteboard when we are together on Thursday and leave it there as a reference point for Vinay</strong></p>\n<p>The diagram will illustrate how the models all fit together and their relationships. </p>\n<p>Nick and I spent a lot of time just sketching out our ideas to start with, I could show you some screen designs I have created, simply by sketching out with pen and paper, nothing more than that. </p>\n<p>We also talked about kind of data we need to capture and use to present the pages of the site, as represented by the diagram.</p>\n<h3>2: Introduce Vinay to GraphCool</h3>\n<p>We are using an online based database system for the project that is packed with innovative concepts but many are based on old fashioned database practices. We have created a number of models for our database which is called Farnborough. </p>\n<p>We can start off by talking about the models relevant to the Walks page we mentioned just now.</p>\n<p><strong>Models</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Walk</li>\n<li>Step</li>\n<li>Photo</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Just show Vinay the list of models on the left-hand side of the screen</p>\n<h3>3: Talk about their schemas</h3>\n<p>We can pick out any of these models by selecting one, in this case we shall go with <strong>Walk</strong> and open up it’s Schema. The schema is essentially the definition of what makes up this Model, it’s fields, types, relationships, constraints, defaults, primary keys and foreign keys. </p>\n<p>We can edit these fields, delete them and add new ones as we wish. </p>\n<h3>4: Talk about their relationships and what they mean</h3>\n<p>TODO</p>\n<h3>5: Talk about the Playground</h3>\n<p>TODO - essentially show him what we can do to query data</p>\n<h3>6: Query datausing GraphQL</h3>\n<p>GraphCool takes it’s name from GraphQL, a technology created by Facebook that allows us to … TODO</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-json\"><code>query <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    allPhotos <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n        name\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span> \n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>TODO add more…</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-c37c0d256c5509c224bd319fdbfa4b24-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypants","value":"<h1>Units</h1>\n<p>The following pages highlight the units we have chosen for this NVQ course and on each page you will find notes explaining what topics we will be covering as part of our day-to-day work at Nick Lewis Ltd (HeadForCode).

Over the past couple of days, I helped them iron out some issues with their documentation.</p>\n<p><strong>content</strong></p>\n<p>This is where we shall spend our time today, getting to know how this works…</p>\n<p>If you open this folder up, you will see more folders (which in the case of this site double up as being called <em>collections</em>). The first folder called assets, is where you should store image files and other such things. Confusingly we currently have two folders called <em>blog</em> and <em>posts</em> which will change I think in the future, as we only actually need the latter.</p>\n<p>Let’s pick out one of the folders and I’d suggest, <em>courses</em> because that is where this page lives and it’s under the folders <em>dandavis</em> and <em>week43</em>, you shouldd find the file called <em>changes.md</em>.</p>\n<p>Open it and have a look.</p>\n<h1>(TODO this is a comment by the way, it wont get rendered to the page)</h1>\n<p>The file is written in something called <em>markdown</em> which is essentially a text file with special powers as it were. I highly recommend taking a look at [TODO: insert link here when I get wifi again!!] as they explain how Markdown works and it is very much an important aspect of this site.</p>\n<p>We are not using an databases for our content, we are instead using static files and when running either <code>npm start</code> or <code>npm run build</code> the website is then converted into a standard HTML site. So we are able to deploy the site via Github and automate a lot of the process. This will become clearer as we work through examples in future sessions.</p>\n<p>That is not to say we can’t use databases for some aspects of the site and I shall introduce some examples as we move along.</p>\n<p>I have created a new folder called <em>danslab</em> under the <em>content</em> folder with a single file in it, you can find that either via the VSC Explorer <code>CTRL+SHIFT+E</code> or another cool way…</p>\n<p>…Press <code>CTRL+P</code> together and a dropdown will appear from the top center of this application. </p>\n<p>Then type <em>danslab</em> and the list of items changes to show about 3 possible files, the bottom one is the one we need, just use the cursor keys or your mouse to select it.</p>\n<p>Voila! This opens up your file in the editor panel and you can have a go at editing it. However before you do, let’s create a branch for you to do this in and here is a new way of doing that, an alternatve to the method we used last time.</p>\n<p>You can create branches from VSC, follow the steps below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Press <code>CTRL+P</code> and a dropdown appears that you can use to search for files or run commands</li>\n<li>Start typing <code>git</code> followed by tapping the <code>[spacebar]</code> and typing <code>branch</code> notice how the dropdown auto-completes when you type?</li>\n<li>You can type the rest in manually or use the keyboard to select the suggestions given</li>\n<li>Let’s type it in by hand this time, so once you’ve typed <code>git branch</code> and added a <code>space</code> type in your branch name which can be any string of text without spaces and lower-case</li>\n<li>Then hit <code>enter</code> anf notice how right down in the bottom left of VSC the branch indicator changes to show your new branch? It also does a “checkout”.</li>\n<li>You can now make changes to the file <code></code>content/danslab/index.md” and read up on [TODO: add link] markdown and what you can do with it. Once you’ve played around, you can send me a pull-request ;-)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So this demonstrates how we can use VSC to do a lot of the things we would otherwise do via the Terminal, personally I prefer doing it this way, it lends itself nicely to getting things done more expressively.</p>\n<p>So to wrap up this excercise, let’s commit our changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Press <code>CTRL+SHIFT+G</code> to switcch to the Git section in the sidebar which you can also click on with your mouse. It will not change the main display in any way.</li>\n<li>Notice that the icon has a counter on it, this is the “number of changes” indicator and at the moment, there will probably only be one.</li>\n<li>Type in a message in the box and once done, as they suggest, press <code>CTRL+ENTER</code> to commit the changes</li>\n<li>Next click on the elipses next to the tick, the refresh icon and a drop-down menu appears</li>\n<li>Choose push (or it might be publish in this instance)</li>\n<li>It will then prompt you whether you wish to publish or not. We do, so say yes. This then creates your branch for you on origin.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That’s it from the VSC side of things, next you will want to raise a “pull request” (or PR for short)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using your browser, go to <a href=\"https://github.com/nickeblewis/headforcode\">https://github.com/nickeblewis/headforcode</a></li>\n<li>Raise a pull request</li>\n<li>I normally get a message but just to be certain, email/slack/nudge me to take a look</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once the pull-request has been checked over and merged back to the master by myself:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can switch back to the master branch in VSC</li>\n<li>Click on the branch indicator at the bottom right of VSC and then in the dropdown that appears from the top, select master</li>\n<li>Then swicth to the Git section <code>CTRL+SHIFT+G</code></li>\n<li>Click on the elipses again</li>\n<li>This time select pull</li>\n</ul>\n<p>DONE! The circle is complete as it were and you can then pick up your next coding task :-)</p>\n<p>In the next article, I will show you some more things, more features of the headforcode project and this will keep us busy for awhile. Though I shall be doing some stuff on it myself most of the time. I will always let you know when is a good time to do a <code>git pull</code> to make sure that you’ve got the latest code available.</p>\n<p>THANKS FOR READING :-)</p>\n<h2>Further READING</h2>\n<p>Summary of other things to read up on</p>\n<p>TODO</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-416280e6d4bb8c21dd126ba586486a48-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypants","value":"<h1>Excercise 1 - Let’s do something…</h1>\n<h2>Pre-flight checks!</h2>\n<p>First of all let us check that we are in the right folder and in the right branch</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code>$ <span class=\"token function\">cd</span> /c/proj/headforcode\n$ <span class=\"token function\">git</span> status\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>We should be in the Master branch, the <code>git status</code> command will inform us of this and you can also tell form the Terminal window too.

You can either <strong>clone</strong> or <strong>fork</strong> the project and we shall start with the former.</p>\n<p>Cloning takes a copy of the project from the server as a compressed file, unpacks it and adds the contents to a new folder based on the name of the repository file.</p>\n<h2>How to go about it?</h2>\n<p>Launch Git Bash via the Windows Start Menu and then change directory to the “Proj” folder that you created in last weeks lessons.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code>$ <span class=\"token function\">cd</span> /c/proj\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Next we want to take a copy of the HeadForCode project from Github and doing this is really quick and easy. Go back to your <strong>Bash Terminal</strong> and I shall now refer to it simply as <strong>Terminal</strong> for now on.\nWe shall use the <strong>git clone</strong> command to achieve this, as follows:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code>$ <span class=\"token function\">git</span> clone https://github.com/nickeblewis/headforcode.git\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Sit back and watch as Git downloads the .git file, which is effectively a Zip file, creates a new folder called <strong>headforcode</strong> and unpacks it’s contents into it for you. You will see a whole\nload of status messages come up on the Terminal screen and after a short period of time, you will once again see the Bash prompt awaiting your next command.</p>\n<p>The next command is to change directories, as we want to jump into the new <strong>headforcode</strong> folder (directory) and see what we now have.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code>$ <span class=\"token function\">cd</span> headforcode\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>You will recall from your CodeAcademy course and our previous lessons that to show the contents of a folder, you need to:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code>$ <span class=\"token function\">ls</span>\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>You should see a number of files present and one of them is called <strong>Package.json</strong>, we don’t need to open it yet or look at it much for the moment, I just want to make you aware of it for now. It’s purpose\nis important because it is required for the next command we are about to issue to work.</p>\n<p>There are two things to learn about later on in another lesson and that is what is package.json and secondly what is JSON? What is a .json file? We shall come back to this…</p>\n<p>For now, issue the following command via your Terminal:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code>$ <span class=\"token function\">npm</span> <span class=\"token function\">install</span>\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>This can take a few minutes to complete and you will see a whole load of messages come up before you. NPM (the Node package manager) is installing a number of files for us, all of wich are listed\nin our package.json file. It saves us all a lot of time sinc you don’t need to worry about what it is installing at the beginning because you just want to get the site up and running for the moment.\nThe details can wait until later.</p>\n<p>Once the command prompt (also called bash prompt) appears once again, that is it, the site is installed and if you type:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code>$ <span class=\"token function\">ls</span>\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>You will notice the addition of a new folder called “node_modules” and it is in here where Node has installed all of the NPM packages required by our website to run and that is precisely what we can\ndo next, launch the site:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code>$ <span class=\"token function\">npm</span> Start\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>This launches the website in a new browser window and we can now start to play with the site. </p>\n<p>You can navigate around the site in the same way you can when accessing it via <a href=\"https://headforcode.netlify.com\">headforcode.netlify.com</a></p>\n<p>To stop the site from running, go back to the Terminal and press CTRL+C at the same time, this kills the process and you can start it up again by running <strong>npm start</strong> once again etc etc.</p>\n<p>NOTE: At the time of writing this, comments are broken, so we shall fix that</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-f6a53ad367a60cc2318b0de997029a3d-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypants","value":"<h1>Lesson 2 - Creating a branch</h1>\n<p>NOTE: I have added you to the Github headforcode project, you will have received an email about this and you may need to click on a link to verify it. This is important, as otherwise some\nof the steps in this tutorial may not work for you…</p>\n<h2>Let’s talk about Git in more depth</h2>\n<p>Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. In any case I recommend at some point\nvisiting <a href=\"https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1\">https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1</a> to learn more about it or take a look at what they’ve got on CodeAcademy.</p>\n<p>When you cloned the HeadForCode project in <a href=\"/lesson1\">Lesson 1</a> it will have not only created a new folder with your project files in it but it will also have created a Git repository as part of that\nfolder. This is why when you change into the folder using the ‘cd’ command from, let’s say the <strong>proj</strong> folder just above it, the command prompt will look like:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code>/c/proj/headforcode <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>master<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Normal directories don’t show the master bit on the end. It is this piece of information that tells you which brancch you are in, as you may have already guessed, you are currently working on\nthe master. Your local has one of these from the first moment you either manually create the Git repository (using <strong>git init</strong>) locally or you clone a project, as you did in <a href=\"lesson1\">Lesson 1</a>.\nThe remote server, known as “Origin” and effectively our <a href=\"https://github.com/nickeblewis/headforcode\">https://github.com/nickeblewis/headforcode</a> project will also have a matching branch of master.</p>\n<p>So when you run a <strong>git push</strong> command the changes you will have added using <strong>git add .</strong> followed by <strong>git commit -m [message]</strong> will get pushed and merged into the remote branch of the same name.</p>\n<p>This takes a little bit of getting used to but once you’ve done it a few times, it will click and then it becomes easy to use.</p>\n<p>So what we are going to do next is create a new branch but why create branches in the first place?</p>\n<h3>The purpose of branches</h3>\n<p>First up, it is bad practice in most projects where more than one person is working on the same codebase. Hence creating a branch for the piece of work that you are doing makes sense. This is for\ntwo reasons.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You can always switch between your branch and the master, useful if you work isn’t going quite right and you want to switch to the “working version” to compare</li>\n<li>One person may be working on re-styling the site based on a company re-brand and the other may be fixing some urgent bugs. You can work independently of eachother without the worry of causing conflicts</li>\n<li>You may be working on fixing one thing and then are asked to work on something else, you can switch back to the master branch, leaving your incomplete work intact and safe where it is.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These are just some of the great reasons for branching. In our case, it will simply be so that we can both work on the same project and not worry about treading on eachothers toes. </p>\n<h3>Lets crack on and create a branch</h3>\n<p>So to create a branch, make sre that you are in the main folder of the headforcode project:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code>$ <span class=\"token function\">cd</span> /c/proj/headforcode\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Let’s do a quick status check on our git repository</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code>$ <span class=\"token function\">git</span> status\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>This will inform you that <strong>Your branch is up-to-date with ‘origin/master’.</strong> and that is to be expected, as we haven’t yet done anything with the project, so far we have cloned it from GitHub,\ninstalled the NPM modules and started it to check that it runs.</p>\n<p>Now we are going to create our first branch and names should be all lower-case, have no spaces etc:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code>$ <span class=\"token function\">git</span> branch <span class=\"token string\">\"mynewbranch\"</span>\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>You should see a message saying <strong>Switched to a new branch ‘mynewbranch’</strong> at this stage and that is great.</p>\n<p>So at this moment in time, your new branch only exists on your machine and we should make some minor changes to a file using Visual Studio Code to see what happens. </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Let’s launch Visual Studio Code via Windows and then open your <strong>/c/proj/headforcode</strong> project folder.</li>\n<li>Find the README.md file in the root directory </li>\n<li>Make an edit to it, just add your name somewhere or something like that, you will see I added my name at the bottom earlier!!</li>\n<li>Now go back to your Terminal and run the following commands one after the other</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code>$ <span class=\"token function\">git</span> add <span class=\"token keyword\">.</span>\n$ <span class=\"token function\">git</span> commit -m <span class=\"token string\">\"Added my name to the file\"</span>\n$ <span class=\"token function\">git</span> push\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>That last command will have displayed a fatal error and this is correct because there is no matching branch on the origin server just yet, we haven’t created one yet and in fact Git will have\nprovided you with some help, the command they suggest is exactly what you need to run next</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code>$ <span class=\"token function\">git</span> push --set-upstream origin mynewbranch\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>NOTE: Future pushes to this branch need only be run using <strong>git push</strong>, you only need to use <strong>—set-upstream</strong> once for new branches.</p>\n<p>This time you will see some positive feedback being output to the Terminal as Git pushes your branch up to Github, so a quick <strong>git status</strong> should reveal that your branch is up-to-date with\n<strong>origin/nicksnewbranch</strong>, nothing to commit, working tree clean.</p>\n<p>Now is a good time to demonstrate what happens when you switch branches</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code>$ <span class=\"token function\">git</span> checkout master\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>If you have Visual Studio Code open still, you will have noticed your changes vanish!!! Oh no!!! This is fine, it is ok, don’t worry! Remember the changes you made were to the other branch and not the\nmaster. If you now type in and run:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-bash\"><code>$ <span class=\"token function\">git</span> checkout mynewbranch\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>You will see that your changes are back and I think this demonstrates the point of branches, you can work on different versions of a codebase (what we call a project of code) and not actually lose anything.\nIt also demonstrates one other thing I have not mentioned yet - the fact that you don’t need to create loads of different directories for different versions of a project. Your <strong>headforcode</strong> folder contains all of the branches, it is almost as if Git gives your laptops folder special powers!</p>\n<h3>Let’s see what is on Github</h3>\n<p>Go to <a href=\"http://www.github.com/nickeblewis/headforcode\">http://www.github.com/nickeblewis/headforcode</a> (and you may need to login with the account you created last week). You will now be viewing the repository. If you look just beneath the description\nyou will see a row of tabs, commits, branch(es), releases and contributors. You should see that we have two branches and in any case, there will always be at least one branch, as the master is always present. It is created automatically for us when creating the repo.</p>\n<p>That will do for now, in the next lesson we will learn how to create a “Pull Request” and talk about “Code Reviews” which we shall use extensively as part of teaching and also in actual projects. In the contracts I do, most companies insist on this process and it is a good one to follow.</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-07023a70f824ac791149c14b649190c1-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypants","value":"<h1>Lesson 3 - Creating a “Pull Request”</h1>\n<p>The last lesson was quite a big one, this is a bit smaller. In the last lesson, you learnt how to create a branch, make a minor change, commit that change and push it up.</p>\n<p>Now supposing this was a bigger piece of work and that you were not just changing a piece of text in a README.md file, we would need to review eachothers work, yes, you will get to review mine too, it is a two way process.\nWe will always review code changes before applying them to the Master branch because in doing so, we are releasing changes to the live site. This process is more a way of checking that what is changing\nis not going to break anything that is currently running ok.

In doing so a merge commit is created automatically by Git but there are a few things to be aware of because sometimes…</p>\n<p>Conflicts can occur!!!</p>\n<p>The pesky Conflict may occur if Git is unable to safely merge your changes with the other branch and this can happen for a multitude of reasons, too many to mention here other than to say… let’s talk more about this when one happens and thankfully Git provides great tools to help us overcome these messier situations.</p>\n<p>In most cases a merge to master will succeed. It is then important for the team (you and I) to be made aware of this in some way because if you merge your branch into master, I will at some point need to make sure my local master branch is updated using <strong>git pull</strong> of course. Same goes for you if it were the other way round.</p>\n<h2>Do we keep branches that are finished with?</h2>\n<p>You can if you wish, yes. However it is way better to delete them once they are finished with. You can do this via Github and in fact when merging Pull Requests via Github it offers the option to delete branches once they’ve been merged. However that will only delete the remote branches and not you local ones. Ask me about this at some point and I can go into more detail.</p>\n<p>There are other git commands I’ve not mentioned yet, such as <strong>git fetch</strong> but I will introduce you to those at the right time via our conversations at the office or over Slack.</p>\n<h2>Netlify</h2>\n<p>Finally - I have configured the site on Netlify to automatically re-build and deploy the site when we push or merge to master. This is super awesome, I love automation and what we call continuous deployment. Workflows are something we shall talk about a lot because the smarter they are, the smarter we can be and it is all very awesome, cool, rad etc etc!!

So for example we can get to the Explorer using <strong>CTRL+SHIFT+E</strong> </p>\n<p>Furthermore we can show/hide the bar by using <strong>CTRL+B</strong> at any time, useful for increasing your editing space on the screen or just to visually de-clutter.</p>\n<h2>Exploring the application</h2>\n<p>Since we have been talking about the explorer and we are here mainly to talk about the app we created in the previous article, lets break down the folders and files that the <strong>create_react_app</strong> generated for us…</p>\n<p>Click on each of the items below to read about each and we shall “drill” down deeper each step of the way:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>node_modules</li>\n<li>public</li>\n<li>src</li>\n<li>.gitignore</li>\n<li>README.md</li>\n<li>yarn.lock</li>\n<li>package.json</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We won’t go into a huge amount of detail on the node_modules, .gitignore, README.md or yarn.lock other than to give you an overview for the time being.</p>\n<p>When you run <strong>npm install</strong> it looks at the <em>dependencies</em> listed in your <strong>package.json</strong> file and installs each of these packages. You can find out more about the package.json file here and it plays a huge role in many applications. The outcome of running <strong>npm install</strong> is that it creates the <strong>node_modules</strong> folder and this is why it is always important to run it the first time you set up a project, especially if you have cloned the project from another repsitory elsewhere. It enables developers to pass their code around and makes it easy for us all to get projects up and running with the minimum of fuss.</p>\n<p>The <strong>.gitignore</strong> file allows you to exclude certain files from a Git repsitory and a classic example is the <strong>node_modules</strong> folder we mentioned just now. Why would you want to exlude it? Well, it is a large directory and it is far more efficient to let the user run <strong>npm_install</strong> to grab all of the latest dependencies anyway! There are other files you may wish to exclude and we always suggest that people exclude config files, especially if they include private data such as access keys. Just think by uploading those to Github you are exposing your system to security breaches! The gitignore file is always referred to by <strong>git commit</strong> and ensures any files that shouldn’t be checked in aren’t!</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-1021f779ee2a39c5b58ba1aeb150b3a9-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypants","value":"<p>todo</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-2941a850771c2a9c2fe9bcb21fb76e94-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypants","value":"<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Polyconseil/react-doks\">https://github.com/Polyconseil/react-doks</a></p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-d9657ec1f7092fb1ca02b95a606acf97-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypants","value":"<h2>Introduction to reactive programming</h2>\n<p>Time to get to grips with what Reactive Programming is and the tools available to us.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reading the following article <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/staltz/868e7e9bc2a7b8c1f754\">https://gist.github.com/staltz/868e7e9bc2a7b8c1f754</a>.

We would then need to build an API to integrate with the third-party database that starts off with no API of it’s own, so we roll our own. </p>\n<h2>Benefits of LoopBack</h2>\n<p>The ability to build your own API quickly and your code is automatically generated along the way.
