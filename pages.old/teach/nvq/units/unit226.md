# Unit 226 - Database Software

Dan - I hope this gives you some clues on these two topics... I will dig around for some more information for you asap.

## 1.1 - Identify the components of database design

* Tables - columns/fields and rows of data values
* Schemas - defining the different types of field such as string, integers etc
* Relationships - keys, primary keys and foreign keys
* Indexes (indices)

## 1.4 - Describe ways to maintain database integrity

__database integrity__ is the concept behind data consistency, that you adopt a set of rules for how you design and build your database. In essence, your database should be a genuine representation of the World that it represents.
