## 5.4 Identify potential improvements to working practices

- [ ] This is subjective so give us your thoughts
    - Oooh wow, very subjective. Thing is though, we are and should always consider that what we do is good but can always be better. Never rest on your laurels.
- [ ] Bear in mind how we can grow as, when and if we have more staff as we are in a new era as a business and have the potential to grow fast over the next year.
    - We won't grow in terms of people but we must develop products and market them. That said I know of some guys who could support us in various ways. I know of a Project Manager who is going freelance, a freelance developer (Lee) and we have Nadeem out in Mauritius.... opportunities to team up with people who can help us.
