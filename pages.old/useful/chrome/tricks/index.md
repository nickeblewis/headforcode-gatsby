The image captured can be the full length screen, including the bits that are not visible. We use this for building up documentation pages and tutorials here on this site. Very handy feature.

## Change your DevTools theme

- We love the dark theme here at HeadForCode!
- CTRL+SHIFT+I
- Click on the elipsis in the tab bar and select settings
- You will find a setting under prefernces for appearance and theme
- Pick "Dark" go for it, do it!
