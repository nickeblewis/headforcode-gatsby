## 15:44 - taking a look through the board

- ** 16929 - Just done a build with this fix, it worked fine. Merged to RC. This appears to have been released as RELEASE-48. Now auto-assigned to James Larter under the resolved column! **
- Helped James earlier with a deployment issue he was having
- Helped Ramana out with timeouts but then realised that this is not something the FE handles rather the back-end services do
- ** 17013 - The EPICC transaction summary page does get truncated, still trying to work out what to do with this **
- ** 16931 - Login button can be triggered by enter key depression which is on Dev. Has this been released automatically to T1? **
- ** 17024 - Doesn't seem to be occurring any longer, can this be put through testing for more feedback? **
